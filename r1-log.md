## Log

### R1D1 
Revising concepts of OPPs along with List, Dictionaries, Sets, Generators, and File Management in Python. Although I am working with python still I was not aware of some great features.

### R1D2
Finished scraping script to get latest launched mobile phones information such as product page link, Product Name, Price from Amazon. BeautifulSoup is quite easy and very nice library for scraping
