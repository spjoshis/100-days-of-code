## Log

### R1D1 
Revising concepts of OPPs along with List, Dictionaries, Sets, Generators, and File Management in Python. Although I am working with python still I was not aware of some great features.

### R1D2
Finished scraping script to get latest launched mobile phones information such as product page link, Product Name, Price from Amazon. BeautifulSoup is quite easy and very nice library for scraping

### R1D3
I learnt Decorators, Memoization and Lambda Operators. Memoisation is a technique used in computing to speed up programs. Amazing, I was not aware about it. I am focusing more on program performance

### R1D4
Learnt automate testing with selenium. It was just for fun. Still need to dig into it but i want to more focus on other modules like numpy, pandas etc. Tomorrow i will do more practice of them
